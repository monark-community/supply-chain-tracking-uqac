# Reporting Security Issues

The ChainProof team and community take security bugs in the project seriously. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge and remediate issues reported to us.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory "Report a Vulnerability" tab for this repository:

https://github.com/monark-community/ChainProof/security/advisories/new

After you submit a report the active team will reply with next steps. We may ask for additional information or provide guidance during triage and remediation.

If you find a vulnerability in a third-party module, please report it to the module maintainer (or via the npm vulnerability contact form: https://www.npmjs.com/support).

## Escalation

If you do not receive acknowledgement within 6 business days, or if you cannot find a private security contact, escalate the report to the Monark Community team at: security@monark.io

If the project acknowledges your report but does not engage further within 14 days, escalation is appropriate.

## Monark Security Notification Process

For more context on the Monark security notification process see the Security WG documentation in the Monark governance repo:
